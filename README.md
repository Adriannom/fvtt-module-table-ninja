# Table Ninja

Table Ninja makes looking up chosen tables swift and stealthy, so you can maintain game flow while using them. Maybe you have a whole bunch of tables for use in game that you never use because play gets too clunky. Or maybe you would use tables for on-the-fly inspiration if there was a slicker way of doing so. If either of these are true, this module is for you.

## Installation

Go to Foundry setup, modules, and add new module:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adriannom/fvtt-module-table-ninja/master/module.json

Then load your world, go to manage modules in the Game Settings tab and enable Table Ninja.

Finally, create a "Table Ninja" folder in your Rollable Tables tab.

## Usage

Put some tables/folders in the "Table Ninja" folder, and click on the new ninja icon on the scene controls and hit refresh.
